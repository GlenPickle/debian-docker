Description: ignore cgroup2 under systemd
 Newer versions of systemd mount a unified view of the cgroups (cgroup2)
 in the cgroup directory.  Docker assumes everything in here is a cgroup
 type and explodes when it is not.  Ignore this unified view in the short
 term as it is not necessarily going to remain constant and has unknown
 security impact.
